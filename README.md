Cleaned up version of code created during one of our Hackaton projects involving the IKEA DIRIGERA.

It is unlikely this will developed much further because IKEA DIRIGERA has the limitation that it does not send signals from any device. This might change in the future, but for now we will most likely explore the route to connect with Zigbee appliances directly.

For the discovery to work, both you development device and the DIRIGERA must be on the same network. In some cases the WIFI network and wired network are separate. DIRIGERA can not connect with WIFI at this point in time.
